This is an essay on the original worse is better argument. Not having read or even knowing what the original argument was at first I didn't understand wtf he was saying. Went back to the HN link (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11097710). Nothing there. I'm still not sure what I was suppose to take away from it.

There are trade offs between perfectionism and pragmatism?

So after writing that I got see wikipedia for definition of Worse is better:  There is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability.

What I take from this:

Get shit done.

Your not gonna see all the different avenues shit you missed until many interations. Write notes, move forward.

If you try to do everything at once nothing gets completed.
