Guy says moral of the story is that PhD's force you to do hard problem solving. It doesn't matter if they are 'void of tangible real-world application'.

Sometimes some bugs are so hard to fix and take so long that it feels like you didn't learn anything but as the author points out maybe you learn non-cognitive skills (grit, resilience, mindset et al).
